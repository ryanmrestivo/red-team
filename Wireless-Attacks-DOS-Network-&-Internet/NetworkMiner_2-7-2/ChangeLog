	underlying TCP stream properly in order to handle TLS record breakes on
	non-even TCP packet boundaries.

	* TcpPortProtocolFinder.cs: Added more default TCP service ports: 8021=FTP,
	5223+8170+8443+9001+9030=SSL

	is still let back in 2.0 so that NetworkMiner will be able to run on as
	many machines as possible.

	* Improved TCP reassembly to support out-of-order TCP segments that are
	paritally overlapping.

	* NetworkTcpSession.cs: Modiefied FinPacketReceived to require a FIN in each

	and stored to the file stream assembler object for better file size precision.

	* PacketFactory.cs: Added support for Per-Packet Information header
	(WTAP_ENCAP_PPI) as used by Kismet and sometimes Wireshark WiFi sniffing.

	into the message tab. Added support to extract emails sent with Microsoft
	Hotmail (I.e. Windows Live) into Messages tab.

	* NetworkCredential.cs:
		- Added extraction of twitter passwords from when settings are changed.
		Facebook user account names are also extracted (but not Facebook
		passwords).
		- Added extraction of gmailchat parameter from cookies in order to
		identify users through their Google account logins.

NetworkMiner 0.91	2009-11-22	Erik Hjelmvik

	* SmtpPacketHandler.cs: Fixed bug where full TCP content length was returned
	instead of 0 when other protocols than SMTP were parsed. This caused
	NetworkMiner to fail when reassembling layer 7 protocol headers that were
	segmented in multiple TCP packets.

	* PacketHandler.cs: Added ability to extract messages from web-based e-mail
	and chat services, such as Gmail, Gmail chat, Yahoo e-mail, MS Exchange webmail
