/*
 * Examining the Mini Web Server
 * 
 * Server sockets use the ServerSocket object rather than the Socket object that
 * client sockets use. There are several constructors available with the
 * ServerSocket object. The simplest constructor accepts only the port number on
 * which the program should be listening. Listening refers to the mode that a
 * server is in while it waits for clients to connect. The following lines of
 * code are used in Listing 1.3 to create a new ServerSocket object and reserve
 * port 80 as the port number on which the web server should listen for
 * connections:
 * 
 * try { 
 * // create the main server 
 * socket s = new ServerSocket(80); 
 * }
 * catch(Exception e) { 
 * System.out.println("Error: " + e ); 
 * return; 
 * }
 * 
 * The try block is necessary because any number of errors could occur when the
 * program attempts to register port 80. The most common error that would result
 * is that there is already a server listening to port 80 on this machine.
 * Warning
 * 
 * This program will not work on a machine that already has a web server, or
 * some other program, listening on port 80.
 * 
 * Once the program has port 80 registered, it can begin listening for
 * connections. The following line of code is used to wait for a connection:
 * 
 * Socket remote = s.accept();
 * 
 * The Socket object that is returned by accept is exactly the same class that
 * is used for client sockets. Once the connection is established, the
 * difference between client and server sockets fade. The primary difference
 * between client and server sockets is the way in which they connect. A client
 * sever connects to something. A server socket waits for something to connect
 * to it.
 * 
 * The accept method is a blocking call, which means the current thread will
 * wait for a connection. This can present problems for your program if there
 * are other tasks it would like to accomplish while it is waiting for
 * connections. Because of this, it is very common to see the accept method call
 * placed in a worker thread. This allows the main thread to carry on other
 * tasks, while the worker thread waits for connections to arrive.
 * 
 * Once a connection is made, the accept method will return a socket object for
 * the new socket. After this point, reading and writing is the same between
 * client and server sockets. Many client server programs would create a new
 * thread to handle this new connection.
 * 
 * Now that a connection has been made, a new thread could be created to handle
 * it. This new worker thread would process all the requests from this client in
 * the background, which allows the ServerSocket object to wait for and service
 * more connections. However, the example program in Listing 1.3 does not
 * require such programming. As soon as the socket is accepted, input and output
 * objects are created; this same process was used with the SMTP client. The
 * following lines from Listing 1.3 show the process of preparing the newly
 * accepted socket for input and output:
 * 
 * //remote is now the connected socket 
 * System.out.println("Connection, sending data."); 
 * BufferedReader in 
 * = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader(remote.getInputStream()) ); 
 * PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(remote.getOutputStream());
 * 
 * Now that the program has input and output objects, it can process the HTTP
 * request. It first reads the HTTP request lines. A full-featured server would
 * parse each line and determine the exact nature of this request, however, our
 * ultra-simple web server just reads in the request lines and ignores them, as
 * shown here:
 * 
 * //read the data sent. We basically ignore it, 
 * //stop reading once a blank line is hit. This 
 * //blank line signals the end of the 
 * //client HTTP headers.
 *  String str="."; 
 * while(!str.equals("")) 
 * str = in.readLine();
 * 
 * These lines cause the server to read in lines of text from the newly
 * connected socket. Once a blank line (which indicates the end of the HTTP
 * header) is reached, the loop stops, and the server stops reading. Now that
 * the HTTP header has been retrieved, the server sends an HTTP response. The
 * following lines of code accomplish this:
 * 
 * //Send the response 
 * //Send the headers out.println("HTTP/1.0 200 OK");
 * out.println("Content-Type: text/html"); 
 * out.println("Server: Bot"); 
 * //this blank line signals the end of the headers out.println("");
 * // Send the HTML page out.println( " <H1> Welcome to the Ultra Mini-WebServer </H2> ");
 * 
 * Status code 200, as shown on line 3 of the preceding code, is used to show
 * that the page was properly transferred, and that the required HTTP headers
 * were sent. (Refer to Chapter 2 for more information about HTTP headers.)
 * Following the HTTP headers, the actual HTML page is transferred. Once the
 * page is transferred, the following lines of code from Listing 1.3 are
 * executed to clean up:
 * 
 * out.flush(); remote.close();
 * 
 * The flush method is necessary to ensure that all data is transferred, and the
 * close method is necessary to close the socket. Although Java will discard the
 * Socket object, it will not generally close the socket on most platforms.
 * Because of this, you must close the socket or else you might eventually get
 * an error indicating that there are no more file handles. This becomes very
 * important for a program that opens up many connections, including one to a
 * spider.
