description: Runs an SMB brute against a list of usernames/passwords. Will check the
  DCs to interrogate the bad password count of the users and will keep bruting until
  either a valid credential is discoverd or the bad password count reaches one below
  the threshold. Run "shell net accounts" on a valid agent to determine the lockout
  threshold. VERY noisy! Generates a ton of traffic on the DCs.
