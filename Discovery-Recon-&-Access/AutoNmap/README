AutoNmap runs a daily Nmap scan, compares the results using ndiff and 
emails the results to a specified email address. 

It also puts a copy of the report into a directory so you can view it
online/share it around, rather than viewing just the diff. 

INSTALL:

Place autonmap.sh in a directory. 
Change the options at the top of the script (e.g. scan subnet(s), email recipient(s))
Add to cron using something like:
    0 9 * * * /usr/local/autonmap/autonmap.sh >> /var/log/autonmap/autonmap.log 2>&1

AutoNmap will then run daily and if there any differences in the port state, it will
email the diff to the specified recipients. The log file should contain some useful 
information in case debugging is required. 


WEB REPORT:

AutoNmap will place a copy of the entire scan output in XML format in a directory
you specify. This is useful when combined with the nmap.xsl XML stylesheet so you can
get a full overview of the state of your network, updated daily. You could easily 
"disable" this feature if you wanted by commenting out the copy step.
