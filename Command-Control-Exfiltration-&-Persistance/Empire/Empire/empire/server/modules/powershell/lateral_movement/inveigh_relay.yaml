description: Inveigh's SMB relay function. This module can be used to relay incoming
  HTTP/Proxy NTLMv1/NTLMv2 authentication requests to an SMB target. If the authentication
  is successfully relayed and the account has the correct privilege, a specified command
  or Empire launcher will be executed on the target PSExec style. This module works
  best while also running collection/inveigh with HTTP disabled. Note that this module
  exposes only a subset of Inveigh Relay's parameters. Inveigh Relay can be used through
  Empire's scriptimport and scriptcmd if additional parameters are needed.
